Active attacks are a type of cyberattack in which an attacker attempts to modify or disrupt network traffic or data. Unlike passive attacks, which involve eavesdropping or monitoring, active attacks are more visible because they involve making changes to the network or data.

Examples of active attacks include:

Denial of Service (DoS): an attacker floods a network or server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

Man-in-the-middle (MitM): an attacker intercepts and alters network traffic between two parties to steal information or perform unauthorized actions.

Injection attacks: an attacker injects malicious code or commands into a vulnerable application or system to compromise it.

Malware: an attacker uses malicious software to infect a target system, steal data, or gain unauthorized access.

Active attacks can be particularly damaging and disruptive, often causing significant financial or reputational damage to the victim. Preventing active attacks involves implementing strong security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-virus software, and conducting regular security audits and vulnerability assessments. Additionally, ensuring that all software and systems are up-to-date with the latest patches and updates can help prevent many types of active attacks.
